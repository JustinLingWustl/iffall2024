            <h1>Homemade Banana Chips</h1>
            <p class="description">A banana chip is a deep-fried or dried, generally crispy slice of banana. It is usually made from firmer, starchier banana varieties like the saba and Nendran cultivars. It can be sweet or savory and can be covered with sugar, honey, salt, or various spices.</p>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>1. First, preheat oven to 90°C (200°F) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
                <p>2. Second, peel and slice bananas into 0.1-inch rounds.</p>
                <p>3. Third, brush each slice of banana with lemon juice, on both sides. Line them over the prepared baking dish, spacing them apart.</p>
                <p>4. Fourth, bake in the hot oven for 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the bananas can be flipped. Flip and bake on the other side for about 30 minutes.</p>
                <p>5. Finally, remove from the oven and let cool completely until they get crispy.</p>
