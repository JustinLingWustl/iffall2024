                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>1. First, preheat oven to 90°C (200°F) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
                <p>2. Second, peel and slice bananas into 0.1-inch rounds.</p>
                <p>3. Third, brush each slice of banana with lemon juice, on both sides. Line them over the prepared baking dish, spacing them apart.</p>
                <p>4. Fourth, bake in the hot oven for 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the bananas can be flipped. Flip and bake on the other side for about 30 minutes.</p>
                <p>5. Finally, remove from the oven and let cool completely until they get crispy.</p>
