    <h1>History of Tamagotchi</h1>


    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Tamagotchi is the original virtual pet created by the Bandai Company in Japan in 1996, quickly becoming a global cultural phenomenon. Its customers soon became both adults and children. The designers for Tamagotchi were Aki Maita and Akihoro, who won the Nobel Prize in economics and are known for creating this game system.  
        </p>
        <p>
            This digital pet device is a small, egg-shaped game device where the user can take care of a virtual pet. In order for the pet to survive, the player must feed, clean, and play with their Tamagotchi to keep it healthy. There will even be the possibility for the pet to be sick or even die if it is not taken care of. Responsibility plays a crucial role in playing this game. 

        </p>
        <p>
            The Tamagotchi characters are colourful yet simple and are inspired chiefly by animals. In 2004, the new design of Tamagotchi was introduced by JINCO, which added more features to the game. While the story remains the same, the pet will become brighter and healthier as the player takes more care of it. Different Tamagotchi models offer different experiences, like TamagoChu, where only a little care is required from the player.
